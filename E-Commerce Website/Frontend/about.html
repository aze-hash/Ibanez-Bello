    <h2>About ShopLife</h2>

    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      ShopLife is a modern e-commerce concept created to showcase a fully 
      functional online shopping experience. While the platform displays a 
      wide variety of products — such as gadgets, lifestyle items, home 
      accessories, fashion pieces, beauty products, and more — 
      <strong>none of these items are actually for sale.</strong>
      This website is a simulated online store developed 
      <strong>strictly for school purposes and as part of a final project output.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      Our mission is to demonstrate how a complete e-commerce system can work 
      by applying proper design, functionality, user experience, and web 
      development principles. This project aims to highlight:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean and responsive design</li>
      <li>Product browsing experience</li>
      <li>Shopping cart simulation</li>
      <li>Smooth interface and navigation</li>
      <li>Real-world development standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Again, all content and products here are 
      <strong>not real</strong> and are provided solely as part of an 
      academic requirement.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Offer (Simulation Only)</h3>
    <p>On this site, you will see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simulated products</strong> – gadgets, accessories, home décor, fashion, and more</li>
      <li><strong>Sample pricing</strong> – for demonstration purposes only</li>
      <li><strong>Mock delivery features</strong> – no real orders are processed</li>
      <li><strong>Simulated secure checkout</strong> – used for learning</li>
      <li><strong>Customer experience practice</strong> – not an actual service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Everything displayed is part of a fictional setup to demonstrate how a 
      real e-commerce platform works.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Shop With Us? (Academically)</h3>
    <p>
      ShopLife is built to create a realistic online shopping environment 
      for learning. This project demonstrates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>User-friendly store interface design</li>
      <li>How product systems work in web development</li>
      <li>Dynamic features such as cart and product details</li>
      <li>Responsive layouts for better user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This platform is <strong>not intended for real commercial use</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      As a school project, ShopLife represents our commitment to learning, 
      exploring digital technologies, and building real-world systems for 
      educational growth. This platform serves as our final project output — 
      showing creativity, technical skills, and dedication to producing a 
      functional e-commerce concept.
